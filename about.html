				<h3>AboutðŸŒŸ</h3>
				<div class="info">
					<p>This website was created for Hydrangea Hacks 2021. I made this in hopes of spreading awareness for those who think the air is harmless, because sometimes, it's not. Factors such as air pollution and even just natural factors can impact the AQI. It's important to stay aware as you may need to reconsider going out on certain days or maybe you can help lower the AQI of your location.</p>
					<p>I believe that many can benefit from learning more about AQI's and the factors that affect them. I also believe it's beneficial for more people to know some tips and resources to stay safe from bad air quality as it can be so damaging to health.</p>
