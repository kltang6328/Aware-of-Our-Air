Aware of Our Air
==================
## What this project does
This project provids users with a map of the USA, showing the air quality of different cities. When a user enters a location name, the site gives information on what the air quality index means and tips on what people can do to reduce exposure.
## Why this project is useful
This project is useful as it creates awareness for our poor air quality and helps by providing some solutions.
## How we built this 
I used the ArcGIS Map Creator from Esri and created a map that only shows the air quality index in the US. I attached this to my webpage created on Qoom, and used HTML and CSS to add information and style it.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
It was my first time using Esri's ArcGIS in a project after learning about it and I think it turned out pretty good. It's also my first time using Qoom for a project and I really like the coding space and editor.
## What is next for this project
I would want to add more features like quizzes on AQI just for fun and for users to test their knowledge on air quality. I also want to change it so that the site can tell what the closest AQI is after given the location being searched, so then it can pop the correct page up on it's own.
